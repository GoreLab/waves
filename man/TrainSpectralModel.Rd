\usage{
TrainSpectralModel(df, num.iterations, test.data = NULL,
  tune.length = 50, model.method = "pls", output.summary = TRUE,
  return.model = F, best.model.metric = "RMSE",
  rf.variable.importance = F, stratified.sampling = T,
  cv.scheme = NULL, trial1 = NULL, trial2 = NULL, trial3 = NULL,
  split.test = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{`data.frame` object. First column contains unique identifiers, second contains
reference values, followed by spectral columns. Include no other columns to right of spectra!
Column names of spectra must start with "X" and reference column must be named "reference"}

\item{num.iterations}{Number of training iterations to perform}

\item{test.data}{`data.frame` with same specifications as `df`. Use if specific test set is
desired for hyperparameter tuning. If `NULL`, function will automatically train with a
stratified sample of 70\%. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{tune.length}{Number deliniating search space for tuning of the PLSR hyperparameter `ncomp`.
Default is 50.}

\item{model.method}{Model type to use for training. Options include:
*Partial least squares regression, "pls" (Default)
*Random forest, "rf"
*Support vector machine with linear kernel, "svmLinear"
*Support vector machine with radial kernel, "svmRadial"}

\item{output.summary}{boolean that controls function output.
*If `TRUE`, a summary df will be output (1st row = means, 2nd row = standard deviations). Default is `TRUE`.
*If `FALSE`, entire results data frame will be output}

\item{return.model}{boolean that, if `TRUE`, causes the function to return the trained model
in addition to the results data frame.
*If TRUE, function return list of c(model, results).
*If FALSE, returns results data frame without model. Default is FALSE.}

\item{best.model.metric}{Metric used to decide which model is best. Must be either "RMSE" or "Rsquared"}

\item{rf.variable.importance}{*If `TRUE`, `model.method` must be set to "rf". Returns a list with a model performance
`data.frame` and a second `data.frame` with variable importance values for each wavelength
for each training iteration. If `return.model` is also `TRUE`, returns list of three elements
with trained model first, model performance second, and variable importance last. Dimensions are
`nrow = num.iterations`, `ncol = length(wavelengths)`.
*If `FALSE`, no variable importance is returned. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{stratified.sampling}{If `TRUE`, training and test sets will be selected using stratified
random sampling. This term is only used if `test.data = NULL`. Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{cv.scheme}{A cross validation (CV) scheme from Jarqu√≠n et al., 2017.
Options for cv.scheme include:
*"CV1", untested lines in tested environments
*"CV2", tested lines in tested environments
*"CV0", tested lines in untested environments
*"CV00", untested lines in untested environments}

\item{trial1}{`data.frame` object that is for use only when `cv.scheme` is provided.
Contains the trial to be tested in subsequent model training functions. The first column
contains unique identifiers, second contains genotypes, third contains reference values,
followed by spectral columns. Include no other columns to right of spectra! Column names
of spectra must start with "X", reference column must be named "reference", and genotype column
must be named "genotype".}

\item{trial2}{`data.frame` object that is for use only when `cv.scheme` is provided.
This data.frame contains a trial that has overlapping genotypes with `trial1`
but that were grown in a different site/year (different environment). Formatting must be
consistent with `trial1`.}

\item{trial3}{`data.frame` object that is for use only when `cv.scheme` is provided.
This data.frame contains a trial that may or may not contain genotypes that overlap with `trial1`.
Formatting must be consistent with `trial1`.}

\item{split.test}{boolean that allows for a fixed training set and a split test set.
Example// train model on data from two breeding programs and a stratified subset (70\%)
of a third and test on the remaining samples (30\%)  of the third. If `FALSE`, the entire provided
test set `test.data` will remain as a testing set or if none is provided, 30\% of the provided
`train.data` will be used for testing. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{vector.input}{The mode of this vector of numbers will be calculated by this function}
}
\value{
`data.frame` with model performance statistics (RMSE, Rsquared, RPD, RPIQ, CCC, Bias, SE, K)
either in summary format (2 rows, one with mean and one with standard deviation of all training iterations)
or in long format (number of rows = `num.iterations`).
Also returns trained model if `return.model` is `TRUE`.
