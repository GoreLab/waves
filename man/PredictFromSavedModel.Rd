\title{Use provided model object to predict trait values with input dataset}
\usage{
PredictFromSavedModel(input.data, model.stats.location, model.location,
  wavelengths = 740:1070, model.method = "pls")
}
\arguments{
\item{input.data}{`data.frame` object of spectral data for input into a spectral prediction model.
First column contains unique identifiers followed by spectral columns. Include no other columns to
right of spectra! Column names of spectra must start with "X".}

\item{model.stats.location}{String containing file path (including file name) to save location
of "(model.name)_stats.csv" as output from the SaveModel function.}

\item{model.location}{String containing file path (including file name) to location where the
trained model ("(model.name).Rds") was saved as output by the [SaveModel()] function.}

\item{wavelengths}{List of wavelengths represented by each column in `input.data`}

\item{model.method}{Model type to use for training. Valid options include:
*"pls": Partial least squares regression (Default)
*"rf": Random forest
*"svmLinear": Support vector machine with linear kernel
*"svmRadial": Support vector machine with radial kernel}
}
\value{
`data.frame` object of predictions for each sample (row). First column is unique identifier
supplied by `input.data` and second is predicted values
}
