\title{Use provided model object to predict trait values with input dataset}
\usage{
PredictFromSavedModel(input.data, model.stats.location, model.location,
  wavelengths = 740:1070, model.method = "pls")
}
\arguments{
\item{input.data}{\code{data.frame} object of spectral data for input into a
spectral prediction model. First column contains unique identifiers
followed by spectral columns. Include no other columns to right of spectra!
Column names of spectra must start with "X".}

\item{model.stats.location}{String containing file path (including file name)
to save location of "(model.name)_stats.csv" as output from the SaveModel
function.}

\item{model.location}{String containing file path (including file name) to
location where the trained model ("(model.name).Rds") was saved as output
by the \code{\link{SaveModel}} function.}

\item{wavelengths}{List of wavelengths represented by each column in
\code{input.data}}

\item{model.method}{Model type to use for training. Valid options include:
\itemize{ \item "pls": Partial least squares regression (Default) \item
"rf": Random forest \item "svmLinear": Support vector machine with linear
kernel \item "svmRadial": Support vector machine with radial kernel }}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} object of predictions for each sample (row). First
  column is unique identifier supplied by \code{input.data} and second is
  predicted values
}
\description{
Loads an existing model and cross-validation performance
  statistics (created with \code{\link{SaveModel}}) and makes predictions
  based on new spectra.
