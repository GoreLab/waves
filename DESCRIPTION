Description: Originally designed application in the context of
    resource-limited plant research and breeding programs, 'waves'
    provides an open-source solution to spectral data processing and model
    development by bringing useful packages together into a streamlined
    pipeline.  This package is wrapper for functions related to the
    analysis of point visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements.
    It includes visualization, filtering, aggregation, preprocessing,
    cross-validation set formation, model training, and prediction
    functions to enable open-source association of spectral and reference
    data. This package is documented in a peer-reviewed manuscript in the
    Plant Phenome Journal <doi:10.1002/ppj2.20012>.  Specialized
    cross-validation schemes are described in detail in Jarqu√≠n et al.
    (2017) <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.12.0130>. Example data is from
    Ikeogu et al. (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0188918>.
