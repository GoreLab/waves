Description: Originally designed application in the context of resource-limited plant research 
    and breeding programs, waves provides an open-source solution to spectral data processing 
    and model development by bringing useful packages together into a streamlined pipeline. 
    This package is wrapper for functions related to the analysis of point visible and 
    near-infrared reflectance measurements. It includes visualization, filtering, aggregation, 
    preprocessing, cross-validation set formation, model training, and prediction functions to 
    enable open-source association of spectral and reference data. 
    Specialized cross-validation schemes are described in detail in Jarqu√≠n et al. (2017) 
    <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2016.12.0130>. Example data is from Ikeogu et al. (2017) 
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0188918>.
