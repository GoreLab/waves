#' @param df `data.frame` object containing spectral data. First column(s) (optional)
#' include metadata (with or without reference value column) followed by spectral columns.
#' Spectral column names must be formatted as "X" followed by wavelength
#' Include no other columns to right of spectra! No missing values permitted.
#' @param test.data `data.frame` object with same format as train.data. Will be appended to df
#       during preprocessing so that the same transformations are applied to each row. Default is NULL.
#' @param preprocessing.method Number or list of numbers 1:13 corresponding to desired pretreatment method(s):
#' * 1 = raw data (default)
#' * 2 = standard normal variate (SNV)
#' * 3 = SNV and first derivative
#' * 4 = SNV and second derivative
#' * 5 = first derivative
#' * 6 = second derivative
#' * 7 = Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter (SG)
#' * 8 = SNV and SG
#' * 9 = gap segment derivative (window size = 11)
#' * 10 = SG and first derivative (window size = 5)
#' * 11 = SG and first derivative (window size = 11)
#' * 12 = SG and second derivative (window size = 5)
#' * 13 = SG and second derivative (window size = 11)
#' @param wavelengths List of wavelengths represented by each column in `df`
