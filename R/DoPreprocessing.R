#' @title Preprocess spectral data according to user-designated method
#' @name DoPreprocessing
#' @description Preprocessing, also known as pretreatment, is often used to
#'   increase the signal to noise ratio in vis-NIR datasets. The \emph{waves}
#'   function \code{DoPreprocessing} applies common spectral preprocessing
#'   methods such as standard normal variate and the Savitzky-Golay filter.
#' @author Jenna Hershberger \email{jmh579@@cornell.edu}
#' @param df \code{data.frame} object containing spectral data. First column(s)
#'   (optional) include metadata (with or without reference value column)
#'   followed by spectral columns. Spectral column names must be formatted as
#'   "X" followed by wavelength Include no other columns to right of spectra! No
#'   missing values permitted.
#' @param test.data \code{data.frame} object with same format as train.data.
#'   Will be appended to \code{df} during preprocessing so that the same
#'   transformations are applied to each row. Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param preprocessing.method Number or list of numbers 1:13 corresponding to
#'   desired pretreatment method(s):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item 1 = raw data (default)
#'   \item 2 = standard normal variate (SNV)
#'   \item 3 = SNV and first derivative
#'   \item 4 = SNV and second derivative
#'   \item 5 = first derivative
#'   \item 6 = second derivative
#'   \item 7 = Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter (SG)
#'   \item 8 = SNV and SG
#'   \item 9 = gap segment derivative (window size = 11)
#'   \item 10 = SG and first derivative (window size = 5)
#'   \item 11 = SG and first derivative (window size = 11)
#'   \item 12 = SG and second derivative (window size = 5)
#'   \item 13 = SG and second derivative (window size = 11)
#' }
#' @param wavelengths List of wavelengths represented by each column in
#'   \code{df}. Default is 740:1070.
