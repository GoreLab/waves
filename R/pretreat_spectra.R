#' @title Pretreat spectral data according to user-designated method
#' @name pretreat_spectra
#' @description Pretreatment, also known as preprocessing, is often used to
#'   increase the signal to noise ratio in vis-NIR datasets. The \emph{waves}
#'   function \code{pretreat_spectra} applies common spectral pretreatment
#'   methods such as standard normal variate and the Savitzky-Golay filter.
#' @author Jenna Hershberger \email{jmh579@@cornell.edu}
#' @param df \code{data.frame} object containing spectral data. First column(s)
#'   (optional) include metadata (with or without reference value column)
#'   followed by spectral columns. Spectral column names must be formatted as
#'   "X" followed by wavelength Include no other columns to right of spectra! No
#'   missing values permitted.
#' @param test.data \code{data.frame} object with same format as train.data.
#'   Will be appended to \code{df} during pretreatment so that the same
#'   transformations are applied to each row. Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param pretreatment Number or list of numbers 1:13 corresponding to
#'   desired pretreatment method(s):
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Raw data (default)
#'   \item Standard normal variate (SNV)
#'   \item SNV and first derivative
#'   \item SNV and second derivative
#'   \item First derivative
#'   \item Second derivative
#'   \item Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter (SG)
#'   \item SNV and SG
#'   \item Gap-segment derivative (window size = 11)
#'   \item SG and first derivative (window size = 5)
#'   \item SG and first derivative (window size = 11)
#'   \item SG and second derivative (window size = 5)
#'   \item SG and second derivative (window size = 11)
